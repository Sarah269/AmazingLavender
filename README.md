## Project Overview
- This project creates a web classification app based on the results of the Respiratory Illness Machine Learning Classification project.
- [Respiratory Illness Classification](https://github.com/Sarah269/glowing-dollop/tree/main/Respiratory%20Illness)

## Data Source
Python pydataset Respiratory

## Tools
- Anaconda
- Python
  - Pydataset
  - Scikit-learn
  - Streamlit
- Replit

## User Story
As a healthcare provider, I want to input patient data parameters into an application, so that I can receive a prediction regarding the likelihood of the patient developing a respiratory illness.

  Acceptance Criteria:
  1.  The application allows me to select or input appropriate values for each parameter.
  2.  After entering the parameters, I can click a button to submit the data for prediction.
  3.  The application processes the input and generates a prediction regarding the patient's likelihood of developing a respiratory illness.
     
As a healthcare provider, I want to see the probability of the predictionâ€™s accuracy alongside the illness prediction,
so that I can assess the confidence level of the prediction.

  Acceptance Criteria:
  1.  Once the parameters are submitted, the application provides a prediction on whether the patient is likely to develop a respiratory illness.
2.  The application also displays a probability score indicating the likelihood of the prediction being accurate.
